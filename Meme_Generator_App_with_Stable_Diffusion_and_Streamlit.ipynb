        "    * **Meme Template Selection:** Curate a library of popular meme templates\n",

        "        a template, then customize captions, while the AI might generate variations\n",
        "        of the template's scene.\n",
        "4.  **Conditional Image Generation & Style Control:** Fine-tune Stable Diffusion\n",
        "    or use more advanced architectures to allow users to specify meme sub-genres\n",
        "    (e.g., \"wholesome meme,\" \"cringe meme\") or visual styles (e.g., \"pixel art,\" \"watercolor\").\n",
        "5.  **Multilingual Support:** While initially targeting U.S. audiences, consider\n",
        "    expanding to other languages to serve broader markets.\n",
