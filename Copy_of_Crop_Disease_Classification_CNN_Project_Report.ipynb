        "- Dataset Biases:\n",
        "  - Image Background: Most public datasets (like PlantVillage) feature clean backgrounds.\n",
        "    Real-world images taken by farmers will have complex, cluttered backgrounds (soil,\n",
        "    other plants, hands, shadows), which can confuse the model. Training with diverse\n",
        "    backgrounds or using segmentation techniques will be necessary.\n",
        "  - Lighting Conditions: Images might be taken under varying lighting (bright sun,\n",
        "    overcast, shade), affecting color and contrast. Data augmentation techniques\n",
        "    (brightness, contrast adjustments) and robust normalization are important.\n",
        "  - Disease Stages: Datasets often contain clear images of specific disease stages.\n",
        "    Real-world images might capture early, ambiguous, or late-stage symptoms, or\n",
        "    even multiple diseases on one leaf, which requires more nuanced labeling and\n",
        "    model training.\n",
        "  - Geographic/Varietal Bias: Diseases might manifest differently on local crop\n",
        "    varieties or under specific Ugandan climatic conditions compared to where\n",
        "    the dataset images were collected.\n",
        "  - Imbalanced Classes: Some diseases are rarer than others, leading to imbalanced\n",

        "\n",
        "- Real-world Variability Not Captured:\n",
        "  - Pests vs. Diseases: Symptoms of pest damage can sometimes mimic disease symptoms,\n",
        "    leading to misclassification if the model isn't trained to distinguish them.\n",
        "  - Nutrient Deficiencies: Similar to pests, nutrient deficiencies can cause leaf\n",
        "    discoloration that might be misidentified as a disease.\n",
        "  - Multiple Diseases: A single plant might be afflicted by more than one disease\n",

        "    limited or no internet access and varying levels of tech literacy.\n",
        "    - Solution: Prioritize offline mobile app functionality (TensorFlow Lite),\n",
        "      user-friendly interfaces with local language support and visual cues.\n",
        "      Leverage community agents or extension workers who can serve as intermediaries,\n",
        "      using the app and advising farmers.\n",
        "  - Smartphone Ownership: While increasing, not all farmers own smartphones.\n",
        "    - Solution: Collaborate with local government, NGOs, or farmer cooperatives\n",

        "  - Misdiagnosis Risk: A misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect interventions,\n",
        "    wasting resources (e.g., unnecessary pesticide use) or leading to total crop loss.\n",
        "    - Solution: Clearly communicate model confidence levels. Emphasize that the AI\n",
        "      is an *aid* and should not replace human expert consultation, especially for\n",
        "      critical diagnoses. Incorporate a feedback loop where extension workers can\n",

        "3.  Develop Multi-label Classification: Implement a multi-label classification\n",
        "    approach to handle cases where a single plant exhibits symptoms of multiple\n",
        "    diseases or pest infestations.\n",
        "4.  Integrate Advanced Image Preprocessing: Explore techniques like semantic\n",
        "    segmentation to isolate diseased plant parts from complex backgrounds,\n",
        "    improving model focus and robustness.\n",
        "5.  Model Optimization for Edge Devices: Further optimize the model using techniques\n",
        "    like quantization and pruning for seamless deployment on low-cost smartphones\n",
        "    and offline functionality.\n",
        "6.  User Feedback Loop: Implement a mechanism within the deployed application for\n",

        "Suggestions for Stakeholders (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, NGOs):\n",

        "2.  Pilot Programs & Rollout: Fund pilot programs in key agricultural regions\n",
